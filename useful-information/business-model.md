# Business Model

## Our business model

Frontity is free. There are no installation costs nor monthly fees.

Publishers will always maintain full control of their advertising and our **monetization** comes from **one ad placement** that they allow us to use on their website. We will just maintain control of this single space and get the income generated through it.

## Our mission

Our mission is to get your site on screen as fast as possible. Our Progressive Web Apps are designed to load nearly instantly and they score 99/100 in mobile performance on [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/).

**Speed is key** to driving revenue for publishers nowadays because it keeps users engaged with their site. A fast user experience on mobile means greater **pageviews**, **conversion** rates, and ad viewability. On the contrary, users who are frustrated by a slow-loading site are more likely to bounce: visit the site once, leave and never return.

We make use of the latest mobile technologies to help publishers boost their traffic and **maximize** their **ad revenue**.

If we fail in our mission, you can cancel anytime and get back to your old mobile version. There's no long-term contract, nor a commitment to stay with us for a fixed period. It is as simple as deactivating our plugin.
