# Exclude URLs in the PWA

You can exclude a specific URL from being loaded into the PWA. This way, if visitors access that URL from a mobile browser, they will see the classic mobile version of your site instead of the PWA.

1. Go to **Advanced Settings** screen of Frontity plugin from your WordPress dashboard.

2. In the ****settings box, go to **Exclude URLs in the PWA**, and **type or paste** the **URLs** you want to exclude \(one per line\).

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use regular expressions too.
{% endhint %}
