# Introduction

Frontity \(or WordPress PWA\) is a WordPress plugin that replaces your classic mobile version with a Progressive Web App \(PWA\).

Our PWAs use the **mobile web** to deliver user experiences that are **fast** and **highly engaging**. They support Google AMP, can be accessed instantly from any device, and are frictionless to use.

We aim to help publishers boost their traffic and maximize their ad revenue by making use of the latest mobile technologies. You can learn more about [our mission here](useful-information/business-model.md#our-mission).
